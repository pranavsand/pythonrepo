ship_type = input("Is international courier yes/no:")
if ship_type.lower() == "yes":
  weight = input("Enter the package weight in Kgs: ")
  if weight==1:
    print("The shipping cost is Rs.500")
  else:
    print("The shipping cost is Rs.",500+(int(weight)-1)*100)
else:
  weight = input("Enter the package weight in Kgs: ")
  if weight==1:
    print("The shipping cost is Rs.50")
  else:
    print("The shipping cost is Rs.",50+(int(weight)-1)*10)
