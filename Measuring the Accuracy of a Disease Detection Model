## Measuring the Accuracy of a Disease Detection Model- Optional
If you're not impressed with these usecases yet, understand that you're just getting started with python. Going forward as a data scientist, you'll be using what you've learned to design machine learning models that just might even save lives!!
Let's say you have created a machine learning model to detect diseases in patients based on their symptoms and medical history. The model has been tested on a dataset of **100 patients**, including **30 with diabetes**, **45 with heart disease**, and **25 with cancer**.
The model's performance was evaluated in three rounds.
In the first round, the model correctly **detected diabetes in 25 out of the 30 patients** with the disease.
In the second round, the model correctly detected **heart disease in 35 out of the 45 patients** with the disease.
In the final round, the model correctly **detected cancer in 20 out of the 25 patients** with the disease.
The model's accuracy is defined as the percentage of correctly detected cases out of the total number of patient
Assess how accurate your model is across these 3 diseases.
